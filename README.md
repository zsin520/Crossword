# Crossword

The program implemented solves a crossword puzzle by satisfying the constraints of the puzzle. We define each word in the puzzle as a variable with four values, the row and column it begins in, the direction of the word, and the length. The model firsts examines the unary constraints, the length of each word in the puzzle. Values that don't match the length can be removed from the domain of that variable. Binary constraints are where overlapping variables occur.
